    <p> I was born in Florence, went to college in Clemson, worked in Charlotte
      when I was a bachelor, and now live in Erie.

    <h1>Cities to Visit</h1>
    <p> As epic as San Fran seems, I must visit to experience it first hand.
      New York to see Broadway shows, and Austin to experience Texas living at
      its best."
